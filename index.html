                        Internal process conditions such as "low glue tank" or "carton tray low" cause the
                        machine to stop in HELD state. Often such conditions require operator attention. If the
                        machine is chronically in HELD state, additional training or supervision might be
                        required. After evaluation, it might be determined that additional operators are
                        required or that other logistical problems exist in the workflow.
