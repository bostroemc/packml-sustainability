                This document describes a preliminary proposal for incorporating sustainabiltiy data into the PackML
                data set ("PackTags"). Our end goal is to track all energy consumption of the packaging machine and,
                combining this with known GHG data associated with the packaging materials themselves, arrive at a final
                estimation of the GHG footprint per unit part.

                        In response to member input, OMAC established the Sustainability Workgroup earlier this year.
                        Members raised concerns to our Technical Advisory Board - a group tasked to guide OMAC's
                        technical direction - that the current PackML specification did not give sufficient guidance on
                        the topic of sustainability. The immediate goals of the group are to identify a core set of
                        machine parameters related to sustainability and then, in keeping with the design patterns of
                        PackML that Rob just reviewed, provide naming conventions and hierarchical organization of that
                        data. Some other questions we are looking at: Are the existing PackTags sufficient or will we
                        need additional ones? Are there other organizations working in this space that we can harmonized
                        our efforts with? We will revisit these ideas later, but first, let's take a few steps back and
                        look at the sustainability landscape.
                    </p>

                    <p class="para">
                        Sustainability is in the news. Headlines from around the world announce pending legislation
                        regarding "climate reporting" or "sustainability reporting". A lot is happening, and it is
                        happening now. Most of these headlines are from this year. Obviously, we will not have enough
                        time to examine all of these - and we don't have sufficient expertise in any case - but let's
                        look at one in particular, the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. CSRD supplants
                        an earlier law, the Non-Financial Reporting Directive or NFRD from 2014. CSRD changes the
                        earlier directive in three important ways. First, it broadens the scope of companies affected.
                        Companies already subjected to NFRD must comply with the new law this year, meaning reports
                        adhering to the new directive are due for these companies next year. Additional companies that
                        will have to comply to CSRD will be phased-in over the coming years. Other large companies will
                        have to report in 2026. Listed small and medium enterprises the following year. And non-EU
                        companies doing sufficient business in Europe starting in 2029. (Roughly a large company is one
                        with more than 500 employees; sufficient business means more than 150 million Euros.)
                    </p>

                    <p class="para">
                        Compared to NFRD, CSRD also puts real meat on the bones of the report. It provides for auditing,
                        meaning that investors have some assurance that the reported data is accurate. (Sometimes you
                        hear the word "greenwashing" - companies pretending to be green when they are not. The auditing
                        mechanism is meant to prevent such fraudulent claims.) The reports must also conform to the EU
                        sustainable reporting standards – ESRS – which is a kind of reporting framework.
